## Description

This is my personal website hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Alongside professional details about myself you would expect in a Curriculum Vitae, it contains links to and live examples of my personal projects and a means of contacting me personally.

## Credits

# Design

Design based on Modern Business Template by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE)).

# Contact form

The contact form for this website uses the Google script from the [example HTML form using a Google script](https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server) by [dwyl](https://dwyl.com/) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server/blob/master/LICENSE)). Only the Google script (amended only to direct emails to me), the code required to encode the message in the correct format (edited to take advantage of TypeScript functionality, the original being JavaScript), and a copy of the Excel file used to log messages have been used.

# Education

[QA Consulting](https://www.qa.com/) taught me how to code as part of their [Graduate Training Program](https://consulting.qa.com/graduate-programme), during which I created many of the projects featured on this website, and during that course they gave me the idea to create this website in the first place.

Much of my experience with [Angular 5](#angular), which this website uses as its framework, has been learnt while working at [Santander Technology](http://www.santandertechnology.co.uk/) (on behalf of [QA Consulting](https://www.qa.com/)). I also created the [React Calculator](https://github.com/AlexMacLeod23/React-Calculator) on their time.

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to my ex-girlfriend Jia Jun for encouraging me to create v1.0 of this website and giving me the idea to include a section about my interests. Your input was a great help then and your idea will be a great addition to the site for v2.0.

Thanks to my friend Antonia, who keeps perstering me to show her new additions to the website each time we meet. Having someone to report my progress to is a good motivator!

Thanks to my friend Meldee, who has been giving me feedback on v1.0 of the website.

## Angular

# Webapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1.

# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

# Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

# Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

# Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
